## Summary:

MExploiting CVE-2017-5941 Deserialization Vulnerability
This exploit takes advantage of a deserialization vulnerability in the Node.js library node-serialize (CVE-2017-5941) to execute malicious commands on the server.

## Description

The exploit leverages a deserialization vulnerability in the Node.js library node-serialize (CVE-2017-5941) to execute malicious commands on the server. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by passing a specially crafted serialized object to a vulnerable application that deserializes the object. This can lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the server and potentially compromise the system.

## Prerequisites
To execute this exploit, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node.js package manager)
- Additionally, you need to have a server with the CVE-2017-5941 vulnerability. In this case, we will provide a server.js file that you can use for this purpose.


## Steps To Reproduce:

1. Installing the Server
2. Download the server.js file to your machine.

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the server.js file is located.

4. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

`npm install express body-parser node-serialize`

5. Run the server with the following command:

`node server.js`

This will start the server on port 3000 of your machine.

## Running the Exploit

1. Download the exploit.js file to your machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the exploit.js file is located.

3. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

`npm install axios`

4. Run the exploit with the following command:

`node exploit.js`

This will execute the exploit and send a POST request to the server with the malicious payload. If everything works correctly, the server will return the output of the executed id command on the server.

The response Deserialized data: {"rce":"_$ND_FUNC$_function (){console.log('RCE')}"}" indicates that the JSON string sent in the body of the HTTP POST request to the /deserialize route on the server has been successfully parsed and converted back into a JavaScript object. In this case, the original JSON string sent contained an object that had an rce property which was a function. The response indicates that the object has been deserialized correctly and now contains the rce property with the value of the original function.

The _$ND_FUNC$_ part in the value of the rce property indicates that the function is an instance of a native Node.js function. This is used instead of the actual function name to hide its true nature and make it harder to detect and block by security systems.

In summary, the response indicates that the malicious JSON string was processed and executed successfully on the server, which means that the arbitrary code inside the rce function has also been executed on the server.

# Conclusion
This exploit demonstrates the importance of being careful when using deserialization libraries in Node.js or any other programming language. It is crucial to consider known vulnerabilities in these libraries and keep them up to date to prevent malicious attacks.
